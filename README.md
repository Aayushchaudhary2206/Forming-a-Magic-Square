  URL https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/magic-square-forming/problem

  In this problem first thing come into mind
  that there are limited magic matrix of 3X3
  and everybody uses brute force method to do this
  but what if 4x4 matrix is there or greater than that
  then you can't remember all matrix
  so this solution provides you better solution
  and this solution can also be modified
  for n size of matrix
